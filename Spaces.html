              <h4>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.</p> 
                <p>here do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have</p> 
                <p>had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>

                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time.</p>
                <p>You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive,</p>
                <p>including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <p>offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p> 

                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,</p>
                <p>thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and</p> 
                <p>take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p> 

                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,</p> 
                <p>but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
