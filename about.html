                  <h2>
                    <p>Come join us at the community Science Museum where we're committed to making science accessible to all.</p>
                    <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water and earth</p>
                    <p>to explore everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>
                    <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries</p>
                    <p>and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the would around us</p>
                    <b></b>
                    <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.</p>
                    <p>This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore</p>
                    <p>Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaurs exhibits - they only come to life at night when everyone's gone home).</p>
